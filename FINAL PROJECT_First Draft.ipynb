    "The goal of this project was to predict the likelihood of injury for a given player in the NFL. The injuries per game, player statistics per game, and team statistics per game data were gathered from the Sportsradar US API. After importing deconding the JSON objects, the data was assembled into dataframes and the dependent variables (outputs) were added to the player stats dataframe. The data was first modeled using a logistics regression."
